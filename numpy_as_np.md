# numpy essentials for machine learning
Numpy is the fundamental package for scientific computing with Python.
- a powerful N-dimensional array object
- sophisticated broadcasting function
- tools for integrating "C/C++" & "Fortran" code
- useful capibilities: - Linear algebra
                       - Fourier transform
                       - Random number
                       
Can be used as an efficient multi-dimensional container of generic data.
